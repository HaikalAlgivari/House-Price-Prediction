# House Price Prediction
Developed a machine learning model to predict house prices using Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, and Deep Learning. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training with fine-tuning, and performance evaluation for accurate predictions.

## Project Overview
The House Price Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model to accurately predict the prices of houses based on various features. This project utilizes a dataset containing information on house attributes such as size, location, number of bedrooms, and other relevant factors. By analyzing and training the model on this data, the goal is to provide reliable price estimates for houses.

## Key Objectives
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
- Gather and clean the dataset to ensure it is suitable for model training.
- Handle missing values, normalize data, and perform feature engineering to enhance model performance.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
- Conduct EDA to uncover patterns and relationships within the data.
- Visualize data distributions, correlations, and other relevant metrics to gain insights.

3. **Model Selection and Training**:

Evaluate various machine learning algorithms such as:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine
- XGBoost
- Deep Learning
- Perform fine-tuning on all models except Linear Regression to optimize performance.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets to train and validate the models.
- The best model identified was the Support Vector Machine, fine-tuned using log-transformed data.

4. **Prediction**:
- Use the trained model to make predictions on new house data.
- Assess the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

## Tools and Technologies
- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries and Frameworks: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning)
- Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion
The House Price Prediction project provides a comprehensive approach to predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. By leveraging the power of data analysis and model training, this project aims to deliver accurate and actionable price estimates.
